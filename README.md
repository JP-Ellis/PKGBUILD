PKGBUILD
========

Packages can easily be created on Arch Linux by creating
a [PKGBUILD file](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PKGBUILD), which contains
all the instructions required to compile and install a particular program.

This repository lists the PKGBUILDs which I have created, or have contributed
to.  A lot of them are related to physics, and in particular, particle physics.

Each package is a separate branch of this repository.
